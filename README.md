# Phase Transitions in Financial Markets: An Entropy-Based Approach to Regime Detection

This project implements an entropy-based framework to detect phase transitions, crashes, and structural changes in financial markets, as well as to attempt to predict when a market is transitioning into a crash.

The code is based on the paper [Phase separation and scaling in correlation structures of financial markets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.06242) by Chakraborti, Anirban, Kiran Sharma, and Hirdesh K. Pharasi. 

# How to use
**Tech used:** Python, Jupyter.  
all dependancies can be installed using  **pip install -r requirements.txt**

The project is split into 2 main notebook files, **phase_transition_modular.ipynb** and **Crash_Indicator_Done.ipynb** which is used to attempt to predict crashes.

In order to run **phase_transitions_modular**, place it in the same folder as the *modules* folder and simply run it cell by cell.  
In case **phase_transition_modular.ipynb** is not working there is also the older non-modular **phase_transition.ipynb**, found in the *legacy* folder, can be used instead.

**Crash_Indicator_Done.ipynb** is self contained and should be ran cell by cell.
